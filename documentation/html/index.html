  <h1>Fontaine</h1>

  <h2 id="what_is_it" >What is Fontaine?</h2>
  <p>
   Fontaine is a command-line utility written by Edward H. Trager that displays key meta information
   about font files, including but not limited to <i>font name, style,
   weight, glyph count, character count, copyright, license information</i>
   and <i>orthographic coverage</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Fontaine is copyright 2009 by Edward H. Trager.
  </p> 
  
  <h2 id="libre">Open Source</h2>
  <p>
   Fontaine is an Open Source program I wrote initially for the 
   <a href="http://openfontlibrary.org/">Open Font Library</a> project.  
   The software is released under the 
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General Public License (GPL) v. 2</a>
   or any later version.
  </p>

  <h2 id="get_it">Getting Fontaine</h2>
  
  <p>
   Fontaine is now a project on sourceforge:
  </p>
  
  <p class="indented">
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fontaine/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/fontaine/</a>
  <p>
   
  <p>
   Anyone may obtain the source code for Fontaine from the SVN repository:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code indented">
   svn co https://fontaine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fontaine
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="building">Building Fontaine</h2>
  <p>
   Fontaine uses the cross-platform <a href="">cmake</a>-based build system:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code indented">
   cd fontaine/trunk<br/>
   cmake .<br/>
   make<br/>
   su -c "make install"    <i>or</i>     sudo make install<br/>
  </p>
   
  <p>
   Fontaine is a new program and, as such, has not yet been tested on a large number of platforms.  The software is known
   to build and run successfully on Linux and OSX.
  </p>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
  
  <p class="code indented">

  <h2 id="output">Output</h2>
  <p>  
   To facilitate different usage scenarios, Fontaine produces reports in
   JSON (default), XML, XHTML, and TEXT formats.  
  </p>
  <p>
   In the source code tree, there is a
   base "MLR" ("markup language report") class from which specific
   reporting classes like JSON and XML are derived.  This architecture
   should make it easy to create additional report formats if needed.
  </p>
  <p>
   A typical output report in JSON format will look something like this:
  </p>

  <h2 id="ortho_groups">Orthography Groups</h2>
  
  <p>
   What do we mean when we say a font 
   provides coverage for “Western European” languages?  Of course we expect that such a
   font will coverage the Latin-based orthographies of the “big” languages of Western Europe, 
   such as <i>English, French, Spanish, German,</i> and so on.  But does that font also provide coverage
   for the orthographies of minority languages spoken –and presumably also written– in Western
   Europe?  It may be difficult to say – it clearly depends on which minority languages we include.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let's look at a perhaps less familiar case.  What does it mean for a font to 
   “provide coverage for Chinese”?  Some Chinese dictionaries include well over 40,000 characters, 
   but a modern educated Chinese person need only know perhaps 3,500 of those to be considered a fluent reader of 
   his or her language.
   So, in classifying a Chinese font, should we require that the font cover 40,000 characters, or just the 
   most common 3,500?
  </p>
  
  <p>
   I asked a lot of questions like these as I began sorting out orthographic coverage categories for Fontaine. 
   I wanted to create categories that would be meaningful to people looking for fonts to meet
   their needs.  Since I myself can't keep <i>ISO-8859-3</i> vs. <i>ISO-8849-4</i> straight, it seemed 
   obvious that a first step required avoiding jargon commonly used by standardization bodies. 
  </p>
  <p>
   Another problem is that adoption rates for scripts vary greatly.
   Some scripts, like Latin, are now used to write hundreds, perhaps thousands of languages.
   It seemed evident that creating an orthographic category for every language written in Latin
   might leave users "drowning" in long reports about hundreds of languages that would be 
   largely meaningless to them.  The only reasonable answer for pervasive scripts 
   like Latin would be to create <i>orthographic groups</i>, but these groups would have to be
   given sensible names like <i>Western European</i> (instead of <i>ISO-8859-1</i>) and <i>Pan African Latin</i>.
   Such names provide even uninformed users with a pretty good sense of what sorts of languages
   might be included without burdening them with hundreds of language listings.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   The orthography work thus required striking a careful balance between opposing forces -- simplicity
   versus specificity. Those forces operate differently on different scripts.  For pervasive scripts like
   Latin, one has to tend toward simplicity at the expense of specificity.  For non-pervasive scripts like
   Japanese, one is at liberty to provide users with a little more detail, such as how well a font
   covers the indigenously-invented <i>Kokuji</i> "national" characters.  For scripts that fall in the 
   middle of the pack, like Arabic, providing specific coverage on major languages using 
   extended versions of the script seemed only prudent.  Thus all Arabic fonts are tested for their
   coverage of <i>Farsi, Urdu, Pashto, Uighur</i>, and  <i>Sindhi</i>, <i>inter alia</i>.
  </p>   
 
  <h2>Orthographic Coverage Levels</h2>
   
  <p>
   Fontaine divides coverage into four levels:
  </p>
   
   <table>
    <tr><td class="theader">Level</td><td class="theader">Coverage</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Full</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Partial</td><td>Greater than or equal to 80%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fragmentary</td><td>Less than 80%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>None</td><td>0% or missing the key character</td></tr>
   </table>
   
  <p>
   Fontaine first looks for a key character (such as the letter <i>A</i> in Latin) that 
   is always expected to be present in a given orthography.
   If the key character is missing, the program skips additional checks for that orthography.  This can
   theoretically lead to false negatives in rare cases, but the occurrence of such a false negative almost
   guarantees that something is amiss with the font anyway.  If the key
   character is present, a full check is made.  If fewer than 80% of the characters needed for an orthography
   are present, coverage is classified as <i>fragmentary</i>.  Incomplete coverage greater than or equal to 80%
   is called <i>partial</i>.
  </p>
   
   <h2>Sample Sentences</h2>

   <p>
    Fontaine's orthography database includes "sample sentences" and
    "sample characters" for each orthography. For many orthographies, the
    "sample sentence" (or sometimes more than one sentence) is actually a
    pangram.  However, since many orthographies, such as Chinese and
    Japanese, don't support "pangrams" per se, I just use the more general
    term "sample sentence" which works across all orthographies.  I
    provide instances of pangrams for those orthographies where I have
    been able to locate them.  Future community contributions will
    certainly be valuable in expanding and vetting the orthography data
    that I have compiled so far.
